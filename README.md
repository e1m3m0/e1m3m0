# Welcome to my GitHub


## About me
My name is **Guillermo Mateo**. Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast and entry-level web developer. My current career is in sales and retail, but Iâ€™m working to become a full-stack developer, versed in many languages, libraries, and frameworks.

I gained most of my developer skills at **UCONN Coding Boot Camp**, which was my first experience writing code. To achieve my goal, Iâ€™m practicing the skills I learned and building my portfolio to meet those expectations.

At the moment, Iâ€™m working to improve the skills learned in the boot camp and gain additional experience with other languages, libraries, and frameworks.

### Current experience:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git
- APIs
- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQL
- React
- NoSQL
- PWA
- Bootstrap
- Angular
- Bulma

### Future development:
- AWS

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project within my current experience level.
